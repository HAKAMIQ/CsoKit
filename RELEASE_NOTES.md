# CsoKit 0.6.2

CsoKit 0.6.2 is a maintenance and release-pipeline update for Windows x64.

## Main changes

- Strengthen release gates by validating central managed and native version wiring.
- Build, stage, and verify the native runtime used by release tests and published outputs.
- Remove a redundant native backend build from the GitHub release workflow while keeping the clean packaging build.
- Clarify supported inspection formats and CSO2 verification wording.
- Preserve existing CLI behavior, native staging, packaging, verification, and release artifacts.

## Supported workflows

- Detect ISO, CSO, ZSO, DAX, and supported CSO2 input.
- Inspect CSO1 and supported CSO2 input.
- Analyze PSP ISO structure.
- Verify compressed containers, including deep block verification and SHA-256.
- Compress ISO into CSO1.
- Decompress CSO into ISO.
- Rebuild readable input into verified CSO1 output.
- Produce structured JSON output for scripts.

## Recommended usage

Recommended compression profile:

    .\csokit.exe compress ".\game.iso" --profile game-safe

Verify important output before deleting the original image:

    .\csokit.exe verify ".\game.cso" --deep --sha256
